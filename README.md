# Live-in-Labs-Water-Consumption-Survey-Data-Analyis
The Project Overview : Studied the needs of a rural, backward and socially-isolated village in Northern India in the context of their developmental goals and social aspirations. Established that “Water stress” arising from poor water management practices was a significant hindrance to the village’s development. A human-centered methodology was followed to collect both qualitative as well as quantitative data and the analysis was performed using both computational techniques as well as qualitative methods. The findings were informed to the stakeholders as well as relevant policy-makers.
